Daniel Bartell & James Kramer, IMM313, Summer 2024

This project, completed for coursework in the IMM313 class, is an early prototype. For the assignment, we sought to envision and design an interaction in VR that allowed the user to roll a die without using or even holding the controllers. 

Usage:

Deploy Build to Quest 2(Intended) or other headset, if table with die starts in front of player then the scene has started properly.
